# Question 4:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q4.png)
For this question, the mistake I made was really silly, I forgot that the int data type doesn't store double values so I ended up messing this question and going for the double option
# Question 13:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q13.png)
This question was pretty confusing and took me a lot of time but the answer is B because the the way this function works is it compares value one and then value 3 then prints out values one and two if the current value is greater than the next value
# Question 24:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q24.png)
This question was pretty easy looking back, I just misinterpretted the function and didn't understand what it meant
# Question 33:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q33.png)
This question was a silly mistake and I forgot that as long as one of the conditions is met, the loop will keep iterating itself
# Question 38:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q38.png)
This question, I messed up because I was speeding thorugh and i clicked on the wrong options and instead of the right option and ended up selecting the wrong operator
# Question 39:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014-MC-Q39.png)
This question I got wrong because I misinterpretted the function and thought that the loop would end after the inital loop so I got 18 but the loop keeps going one more time
# Final Score:
