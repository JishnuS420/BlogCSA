    "On the frontend, as the primary Frontend Developer, I was commiting very frequently on the Frontend and would work on improving our page in many ways as possible, this involves updating the styling as well as just overall frontend modifications such as when we swapped frameworks from Svelte to normal HTML pages and I had to constantly work with people and contributed in some way to each of my team memebers execept for Alex, For example, me and Derrick were on the same boat, getting used to learning working with such a fast paced group so we would help each other out on various issues we came across.\n",

    "# Blog Usage:\n",

    "- Storing important lessons and hacks [Timebox](https://jishnus420.github.io/BlogCSA/csa)\n",
    "- Planning my hacks and weekly objectives [Timebox](https://jishnus420.github.io/BlogCSA/csa), [Scrumboard](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3)\n",

    "# Overall Reflection:\n",
    "This trimester was really stressful overall with college applications and everything and this trimester I wasn't very code/tangible heavy but I definetly feel myself contributing in some aspects for myself and my team\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glows:\n",
    "In my previous learning experiences from CSP, I always struggled to work with my team, I would either work alone or only work with one person, one area that I definetly felt myself glow in was the **collaboration** aspect of this class, working with this team and helping each other out was something that I never really experienced in this class before and I felt myself actually having an impact on my team as a whole and I took away a lot of learning from this trimester and wish to keep collaborating a lot with my future teams\n",
    "\n",
    "Another glow in my opinion was my **understanding of tools and code** in general. Previously i struggled with comprehending code and struggled to recall information but after constant usage of features like commenting and using external tools like ChatGPT or my peers to help me understand complex problems has helped deepen my knowledge and understanding of code in this class\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the agile manifesto and working **planned** and according to a preset order but also expanding it responsibly has also been a glow for me. Previously I would just do whatever I needed to by the deadline but this trimester, setting plans and goals for myself throughout the week has definetly been one of my glows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grows:\n",
    "One of the many things I need to grow on is definetly **coding more rountinely**, I code whenever I feel like it and although I definetly made a large improvement in this area in the past few weeks, its something that im trying to keep going in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I need to grow on is my **backend skills**, I feel that I have been a Frontend Developer for so long and I feel that I need to have more experience working with code in the backend and working more with Java instead of Javascript, I realized that by being a Frontend Developer, I am not really able to like expand my learning and challenge myself with a difficult topic, I have worked in basically every Scrum Position but the Backend Developer so next trimester I want to be a Backend Developer and this will also help me with my next grow\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary problem that I want to solve that I have is **showing my tangibles and their progress as well as learning**, by always doing Frontend work all the time, I feel like I am not growing and learning as much as I could and instead I am holding back myself and so I want to be Backend Developer next trimester and improve on my skills of documenting progress through a tough challenge."
