    "The experience is horrible all the way from the parking to getting into the park. Once you finally make it into the park you're already exhausted. Lines to get on rides are ridiculously long.We bought the fast pass and it's pointless because it does not get you on rides any faster,do not buy it you have to schedule rides through it, it's stupid. Overall everything is too expensive and within minutes of being at the park I just wanted to leave and wish that I didn't waste my money on this. It's overly packed with no comfortability. I gave up and just left I really wish I could get a refund because the experience is not worth all the hype.\n",

    "What a great park! What it separates it from other theme parks from all over the world is that it feels like you are really in a Disneyland because even the sky is not real because it’s kind of built up to a certain point… Mountains with snow etc… The rides are great, the waiting time is always displayed and it doesn’t really feels like waiting because they show you always some specials things on the way, sometimes you don’t even know on which point the ride is really starting. Great experience!!!\n"
