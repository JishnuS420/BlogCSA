    "- Encapsulation is done through using classes and access modifiers\n",

    "- Encapsulation allows for protection against other parts of the program by preventing them to modify it\n",

    "### Access Control \n",
    "\n",
    "- Determines what is visible and what isn't in a program and protects data integrity \n",
    "\n",
    "- The exam might ask questions that will cause you to decide and apply the right access modifiers (private, public) and the MC section might even test your ability to determine which ones are incorrect and why\n",
