    "- Some challenges that I ran into while taking this test was using my time efficiently, I was spending more time on a question that was hard just to get it wrong and I need to be able to solve tougher questions much faster and easier since spending time just to get a question wrong can be a big waster of time however, it is good that I am taking time on harder questions at the same time.\n",
    "- Another big struggle is that I would lose my train of thought and had to sometimes completely restart, this was a problem especially for the harder questions I would end up spending much more time on the questions than I originally wanted to. I did end up grabbing a paper towards the end of the test though to help me track down and note the steps I had taken"
