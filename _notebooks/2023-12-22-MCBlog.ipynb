    "- Another big struggle is that I would lose my train of thought and had to sometimes completely restart, this was a problem especially for the harder questions I would end up spending much more time on the questions than I originally wanted to. I did end up grabbing a paper towards the end of the test though to help me track down and note the steps I had taken"

    "- Another thing that I learned that helped me this test compared to the last test was that I used a scratch piece of paper to help formulate and plan out steps for different questions that I came across in the test. \n",
    "- Another key learning that I took away from this test was the terminology and wording used by the college board tries ot trick you and purposefully tries to make you select the wrong answer and you need to take your time understanding and making sure to double check every question and answer choice and understand it."

    "- Also want to work more with 2D arrays and loops that include arrays since these are the questions that I am struggling thw most with and working with them might improve my understanding in these topics. \n",
    "- I also want to maybe time myself next time and understand how I am doing in terms of time and using my time efficiently on the questions and optimizing the time that I take for each question."
