This kernel provides a shell, or <mark>terminal</mark>, that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands.  Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell/terminal as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process.  To activate a shell directly, users will run a \"terminal\" through the Desktop. <mark>VS Code provides ability to activate \"terminal\"</mark> while in the IDE."

      "- The purpose is to build lessons and distribute across different Computer Science sections (CSSE, CSP, CSA), a pathway that covers 3 years of High School Instruction.\n",
      "- The primary languages and frameworks that are taught are `JavaScript/HTML/CSS`, `Python/Flask`, `Java/Spring`.  Read below for more details.\n",

JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common.\n",
