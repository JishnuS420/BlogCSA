    "# Introduction\n",
    "- In Java, there are two main types of data types primitive/value types and reference types.  \n",
    "- We will be using the terms stack and heap here to describe memory allocation. \n",
    "    - The stack: Temporary memory were were values are stored and methods called,after a method has finished executing the memory is cleared.\n",
    "    - The heap: The heap memory is the memory created by th JVM when it is started and is used while the application is still running, it is used to allocate memory to objects and JRE classes.\n",
    "    - [Learn More](https://stackify.com/java-heap-vs-stack/#:~:text=Java%20Heap%20Space%20is%20used,be%20accessed%20throughout%20the%20application)\n",
    "- This is not typically present explicitly in any CollegeBoard questions however is a recurring theme that will need to be understood to be able to understand and solve problems on the exam.\n",

    "# Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Information\n",
    "- Reference types are a subclass of the java.lang.Object class.\n",
    "- Reference types can be defined by the user\n",
    "- When two references are assigned to each other the will both point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "- When objects are passed into an object the method changes the content of the object but not the location of the object in memory.\n",
    "- A reference type is a reference to the actual data, that is they allow for us to be able to access objects stored elsewhere in memory. What typically occurs when we create a reference type the object is stored onto the stack and the value that corresponds to the object is stored in the heap. For instance if we create a Cat class: "
